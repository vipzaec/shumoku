/**
 * Shumoku Layout — public surface.
 *
 *   - `createEngine(config)` — rule authority. Provides sizing,
 *     placement-policy queries, text measurement.
 *   - `autoLayoutFlatTree(graph, engine, options)` — the
 *     flat-tree auto-placement algorithm. Most callers go
 *     through `computeNetworkLayout` (below), which sets up
 *     a default engine + edge routing.
 *   - `computeNetworkLayout(graph)` — convenience entry that
 *     internally calls `autoLayoutFlatTree` and routes edges.
 *   - `resolveNodeSize(node)` — returns `node.size` if set,
 *     otherwise asks an engine for the body size.
 *
 * Manual placement uses the same engine via `engine.tryPlace`
 * so layout and drag-snap stay consistent.
