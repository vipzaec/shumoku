 * Layout constraint registry — the single declarative source of the

 * Interference avoidance used to live as ~20 scattered mechanisms in three
 * styles (constructive gaps, after-the-fact repairs, score penalties), and
 * every new pass re-opened the same holes — invariants.ts's own lesson
 * ("every visual defect was a silently unchecked invariant violation").
 * This registry declares each prohibition ONCE; verification derives from
 * the same definitions, so the spec and the check cannot drift.
 *
 * Enforcement levels (honest, per current engine capability):
 *  - 'blocking'   — guaranteed by the engine today; a violation is a BUG.
 *                   Asserted after every layout in dev/test.
 *  - 'warn'       — measured and reported; enforcement lands with the VPSC
 *                   projection stage (#483).
 *  - 'score-only' — currently only weighted in the search cost; promotion
 *                   tracked by its own issue (#485 for piercing).
 *
 * Aesthetics (crossings, wire length, aspect) are deliberately NOT here —
 * they are soft objectives owned by the search cost, never prohibitions.
