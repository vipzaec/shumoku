 * - Port and Edge are computed types with absolute coordinates
 * - libavoid, SVG renderer, and any other consumer use the same coordinates
 *
 * Processing pipeline:
 * 1. Node placement → Node[] with position set
 * 2. Port placement → ResolvedPort[] (absolute position, using node position + link info)
 * 3. Edge routing  → ResolvedEdge[] (routed through port absolute positions)
 * 4. Rendering     → draw each object using absolute coordinates
