 * Edge-routing pass.
 *
 * Now that edges render as cubic Bezier curves directly from port
 * coordinates in the renderer, the routing pass collapses to a
 * trivial constructor: every edge gets a 2-point "polyline" of
 * `[from.absolutePosition, to.absolutePosition]`. The renderer
 * ignores these points for the drawn path and computes a curve from
 * the port sides instead. The points stay on `ResolvedEdge` only so
 * non-rendering consumers (label midpoint, hit testing, static
 * export, BOM cable-length) keep working without a separate code
 * path.
 *
 * History: this file replaces the previous `libavoid-router.ts` (orthogonal
 * routing via libavoid-js WASM + Sugiyama channel routing + bend
 * post-process). All of that became unused when the bezier renderer
 * shipped as the default; keeping it added ~3500 lines of dead code
 * and a 500KB WASM blob to the bundle. See PR #227 for the bezier
 * switch and the refactor that immediately followed.
 *
 * Lane offset post-process: when N>1 edges share a source or target
 * port the curves all leave / arrive at the same point and stack
 * visually on top of each other. The post-process assigns a lateral
 * offset per edge (perpendicular to the port's outward normal) so
 * the curves fan apart at the shared port. Order along the lane is
 * by the peer endpoint's coordinate along the lateral axis, which
 * keeps the lanes parallel to the source→target progression and
 * minimises additional crossings.
 *
 * Bus routing post-process: when N>=3 edges from the same node fan
 * out to roughly-coplanar children (same downstream layer), the
 * router rebuilds them as a single horizontal backbone with vertical
 * stubs ("T-shaped tree"). Each edge becomes a 4-point orthogonal
 * polyline (source port → trunk attach → backbone leave → target
 * port) sharing the middle segment with its siblings via a common
 * `busId`. The bus replaces the default Bezier on a per-edge basis;
 * mixed graphs (some bus, some Bezier) work without extra wiring.
