/**
 * Topology Observations Service
 *
 * Manages the `topology_observations` table — one append-only row per
 * source-snapshot. This is the **audit / history log** (status, captured-at,
 * counts, raw graph for the history-detail view): it powers the "Recent
 * observations" surfaces and the retraction-hysteresis counter.
 *
 * It is NO LONGER what the resolver reads. The canonical observed state — the
 * latest graph each external source contributes — now lives DB-native in the
 * `contribution_*` store (one `contribution_source` row per attached source,
 * decomposed into queryable element/link/attachment rows). `record()` is the
 * single choke point every observed writer funnels through, so it materializes
 * that contribution here too: in one transaction it ingests the graph into the
 * contribution store (canonical) and appends the audit row (history) — a
 * current-state table + event log that can't diverge; see db-native-persistence.md.
 *
 * Design references:
 *   - apps/server/docs/design/db-native-persistence.md
